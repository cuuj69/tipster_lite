Define the requirements and scope of the project: Determine the exact functionality of the app and the features that you want to include.

Design the app's architecture: Determine how the app will be structured and the technologies that you'll use. This includes selecting the database, APIs, and tools you'll use.

Build the backend: Build the server-side of the app using TypeScript and GraphQL.

Build the frontend: Build the client-side of the app using React and Redux.

Integrate the backend and frontend: Connect the backend and frontend using APIs.

Design the database schema: Determine how the data will be stored and organized in PostgresSQL and Redis.

Build the database: Set up the database using the schema that you've designed.

Implement CI/CD pipeline: Configure Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana to automate the deployment process.

Set up testing: Develop automated tests for both the backend and frontend to ensure that the app works as expected.

Implement Agile development practices: Adopt Scrum, sprints, daily scrums, sprint backlog, and sprint review and retrospectives, to ensure efficient project management.

Integrate AWS services: Consider how Amazon Web Services (AWS) can be integrated into the app to improve its functionality and scalability.

Implement Asana board: Create an Asana board to track the progress of the project and to ensure that all team members are aware of their tasks and deadlines.

Develop a user interface (UI) design: Determine how the app's UI will look and feel, and create a design that is visually appealing and intuitive.

Implement user authentication and authorization: Implement a user authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access the app.

Set up analytics and reporting: Use tools such as Google Analytics or Kibana to track user behavior and generate reports on app usage.

Develop a marketing plan: Develop a plan to promote the app and attract users. This may include social media marketing, content marketing, and paid advertising.

Develop a monetization strategy: Determine how the app will generate revenue, whether through advertising, in-app purchases, or a subscription model.

Consider scalability: Determine how the app will handle increased traffic and usage as the user base grows. This may involve implementing load balancing, autoscaling, and other techniques.

Develop a disaster recovery plan: Plan for contingencies such as server failures or data breaches and develop a plan for how to respond to these events.

Conduct user testing and feedback: Test the app with a group of beta users to get feedback on the app's functionality, user experience, and overall value proposition. Use this feedback to make improvements to the app before launching it to a wider audience.
