Frontend:

Set up the development environment: Install the necessary tools such as Node.js, React, Redux, TypeScript, and any other dependencies you may need for your project.
Build the frontend UI: Use React and Redux to create a UI that allows users to input match details and view the predicted outcomes.
Implement API calls: Use the Apollo Client library to make GraphQL API calls to the backend and fetch the required data.
Backend:

Set up the development environment: Install the necessary tools such as Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana, and any other dependencies you may need for your project.
Design the app's architecture: Determine how the app will be structured and the technologies that you'll use. This includes selecting the database, APIs, and tools you'll use.
Create a GraphQL schema: Define the types and queries that will be used in the API using GraphQL syntax.
Set up a database: Use PostgreSQL to create a database to store match details, team stats, and other data required for the prediction engine.
Implement resolvers: Use TypeScript to implement the resolvers for the GraphQL queries that will fetch data from the database.
Set up Kafka: Use Kafka to manage real-time data streaming between different parts of the application.
Build the prediction engine: Using the data you have collected from the API and other sources, build a prediction engine that can predict the number of goals to be scored in a match and which team is likely to score at least one goal.
Set up the backend: Build a GraphQL API using TypeScript to handle requests from the frontend and fetch data from the database.
Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy server: Use Nginx to handle incoming requests and distribute them to the backend servers to improve performance and security.
Set up a testing environment: Use testing frameworks such as Jest to test your application's functionality.
Use Prometheus: Use Prometheus to monitor the performance of the application and the server.
Use Grafana: Use Grafana to visualize the performance metrics collected by Prometheus.
Implement CI/CD: Use Jenkins and GitHub Actions to set up continuous integration and continuous deployment, respectively. Use Docker and Kubernetes to deploy your application.
Use Asana or a similar project management tool to track tasks and tickets.
Add an AWS free service to the project, such as Amazon S3 for storing static files, or Amazon DynamoDB for a NoSQL database.
Additional senior backend concepts: Some additional concepts you may want to consider adding to your project include load balancing, serverless architecture, caching, and security protocols such as OAuth and JWT.
