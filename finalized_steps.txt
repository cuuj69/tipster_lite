Set up your development environment: Install the necessary tools such as Node.js, React, Redux, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, and any other dependencies you may need for your project.

Start building the core algorithm: Begin by creating a function that calculates the number of goals accrued in recent head-to-head games between two teams. Test your function to ensure it works correctly.

Integrate with the SofaScore API: Use the API to fetch upcoming matches and their details such as home/away teams, previous matches, and other match details.

Build the prediction engine: Using the data you have collected from the API and other sources, build a prediction engine that can predict the number of goals to be scored in a match and which team is likely to score at least one goal.

Implement other match determining factors: Once the core prediction algorithm is working, you can add other factors such as weather conditions, team lineup, league table stats, and reviews from top-rated tipsters to fine-tune the prediction.

Build the frontend: Using React and Redux, create a simple and minimalistic UI that allows users to input match details and view the predicted outcomes.

Set up the backend: Build a GraphQL API using TypeScript to handle requests from the frontend and fetch data from the database.

Create a database: Use PostgreSQL to create a database to store match details, team stats, and other data required for the prediction engine.

Set up a testing environment: Use testing frameworks such as Jest to test your application's functionality.

Implement CI/CD: Use Jenkins and GitHub Actions to set up continuous integration and continuous deployment, respectively. Use Docker and Kubernetes to deploy your application.

Use Asana or a similar project management tool to track tasks and tickets.

Add an AWS free service to the project, such as Amazon S3 for storing static files, or Amazon DynamoDB for a NoSQL database.
