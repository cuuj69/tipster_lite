Set up your development environment: Install the necessary tools such as Node.js, React, Redux, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Nginx, Prometheus, Grafana, and any other dependencies you may need for your project.

Design the app's architecture: Determine how the app will be structured and the technologies that you'll use. This includes selecting the database, APIs, and tools you'll use.

Create a database: Use PostgreSQL to create a database to store match details, team stats, and other data required for the prediction engine.

Start building the core algorithm: Begin by creating a function that calculates the number of goals accrued in recent head-to-head games between two teams. Test your function to ensure it works correctly.

Integrate with the SofaScore API: Use the API to fetch upcoming matches and their details such as home/away teams, previous matches, and other match details.

Use Kafka for real-time data processing: Set up Kafka to handle real-time streaming data such as live scores, betting odds, and other relevant data.

Build the prediction engine: Using the data you have collected from the API and other sources, build a prediction engine that can predict the number of goals to be scored in a match and which team is likely to score at least one goal.

Implement other match determining factors: Once the core prediction algorithm is working, you can add other factors such as weather conditions, team lineup, league table stats, and reviews from top-rated tipsters to fine-tune the prediction.

Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy server: Use Nginx to handle incoming requests and distribute them to the backend servers to improve performance and security.

Set up Prometheus for monitoring: Use Prometheus to monitor your application's health and performance metrics.

Use Grafana for data visualization: Set up Grafana to create real-time dashboards and visualizations to help you monitor and analyze your application's performance.

Build the frontend: Using React and Redux, create a simple and minimalistic UI that allows users to input match details and view the predicted outcomes.

Set up the backend: Build a GraphQL API using TypeScript to handle requests from the frontend and fetch data from the database.

Set up a testing environment: Use testing frameworks such as Jest to test your application's functionality.

Implement CI/CD: Use Jenkins and GitHub Actions to set up continuous integration and continuous deployment, respectively. Use Docker and Kubernetes to deploy your application.

Use Asana or a similar project management tool to track tasks and tickets.

Finally, learn the software development process: Learn about agile methodologies, sprints, deadlocks, QA, daily scrum, and other software development processes.
