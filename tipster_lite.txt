Prediction app

An app aide that fine tunes football match prediction

Core aims will be to create an app that can accurately predict at least two goals to be scored in a match, and which team to score at least one goal

Mechanism

Most current head to head
goal scored in those recent games 
get goals scored in away game
get goals scored in home game

check time of goal scored

So the core determining factor is the number of goals accrued in those head to head games

if most recent games head to head  goals are less than 1: exempt that team in question

Other match determining factors include:
Grounds(Home or Away)
Team lineup (Are they missing any key players)
Stat from most recent game(include the time the goal was scored from that previous match)

Proposed weather condition for matchday

Most importantly stats from leauge table
how can we infer the severity of the match, what it means for which team to win it .

Can we also get some reviews and remarks from top rated tipsters sharing predicting which team should win and why they think they should win

Tools I intend to use for this project

Frontend

Redux

Backend
Typescript

Database
Postgresql
Redis

Api
Graphql
Testing

CI/CD
Jenkins
docker and containerization
github actions

devops




Now I need to see whether there is a way I can get some AWS services running in this project
